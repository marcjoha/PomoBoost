PomoBoost
=========

*The Pomodoro Technique* (http://www.pomodorotechnique.com/) is a method for effectively managing your time by working in slots of 25 minutes.

This small utility sits in your Windows 7/8 task bar, and notifies you when the current time slot is up. There's nothing else to it. After all, you should focus on your task, not the tool.
